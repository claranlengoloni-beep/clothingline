                    Aura & Thread Collective began as <strong>Thrift Thrills</strong>, a passion project 
                    dedicated to the hunt for hidden gems and the belief that quality should be 
                    accessible. We spent years identifying the superior stitch-work of vintage 
                    garments and the enduring feel of natural fibers.

                    As we curated the past, we began to envision the future. We took the lessons 
                    of durability and timeless style from our "thrift" roots and infused them into 
                    a new standard of professional wear.
